    There are an average of two exchanges per item (n items and n exchanges)
    The maximum number of exchanger for a single item is n - 1
        Imagine the following array:
            10 1 2 3 4 5
        In this case, 10 would be exchanged at each step
            count = 1
            1 10 2 3 4 5
            count = 2
            1 2 10 3 4 5
            count = 3
            1 2 3 10 4 5
            count = 4
            1 2 3 4 10 5
            count = 5
            1 2 3 4 5 10
