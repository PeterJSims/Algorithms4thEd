With my mediocre discrete mathematics skills, I am definitely not topping this:

From the above:

The key here, quoting from the section Infinite descent in the wikipedia article on mathematical induction, is
"... there are no infinite decreasing sequences of natural numbers"

Here we provide constructions/hints and leave the organization/exposition of the theory to the interested reader.

Recall that we have the first projection mapping 𝜋1 on ℤ+×ℤ+ defined by:

∀(𝑚,𝑚)∈ℤ+×ℤ+:𝜋1(𝑚,𝑛)=𝑚

Define 𝑃={(𝑚,𝑛)∈ℤ+×ℤ+∣𝑚≥𝑛}. Recall that the set 𝑃 contains the diagonal set

Δℤ+={(𝑑,𝑑)∣𝑑∈ℤ+}.

We define the function 𝐹:𝑃→𝑃 as follows

𝐹(𝑚,𝑛)={(𝑚,𝑛)       if 𝑚=𝑛
        (𝑚−𝑛,𝑛)   if 𝑚−𝑛≥𝑛
        (𝑛,𝑚−𝑛)   if 𝑚−𝑛<𝑛}

If (𝑚,𝑛)∈𝑃 we can apply the gcd function. Note that for elements (𝑑,𝑑) in the diagonal Δℤ+,

            gcd(𝑑,𝑑)=𝑑

Now it is well known that

            gcd(𝑚,𝑛)=gcd(𝐹(𝑚,𝑛))

For fixed (𝑠,𝑡) in the domain of 𝐹 we define a sequence

            𝑎𝑘=𝜋1∘𝐹𝑘(𝑠,𝑡)

By using the absurdity of an infinite descent, the sequence (𝑎𝑘) eventually 'stops decreasing and remains constant.
That happens precisely when the algorithm 𝐹 'hits the diagonal.

So the algorithm 𝐹 'gets us' to the diagonal in a finite number of steps, and from there we can just 'read off' greatest common divisor.

Example: Let 𝑚=28 and 𝑛=10 so that (𝑚,𝑛) belongs to the domain of 𝐹.

𝐹(28,10)=(18,10)
𝐹(18,10)=(10,8)
𝐹(10,8)=(8,2)
𝐹(8,2)=(6,2)
𝐹(6,2)=(4,2)
𝐹(4,2)=(2,2) STOP

Of course if you don't want to stop you can continue to apply 𝐹. But the points on the diagonal are exactly
the fixed points of 𝐹, so you will quickly lose interest.

The point (2,2)∈Δℤ+ and so gcd(28,10)=2.
