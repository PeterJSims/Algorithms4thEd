1.1.4 What (if anything) is wrong with each of the following statements?
    a. if (a > b) then c = 0;
        'then' is not a keyword in java

    b. if a > b { c = 0; }
        comparisons must be in brackets

    c. if (a > b) c = 0;
        if c was already declared then nothing, otherwise c needs a type

    d. if (a > b) c = 0 else b = 0;
        'else' is not a keyword in java
